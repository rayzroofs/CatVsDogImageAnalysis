# CatVsDogImageAnalysis
Matlab code analyzing features of cats and dogs, using 25 images of one cat breed and 25 images of one dog breed, with attempts to distinguish the animal.

File order to get to end results:

final_run_and_classify
	-this will run the following MatLab files and store prediction results in "finalDogTestResult" and "finalCatTestResult"
